extract the file -> say name "dj_store"

1. install python form this link "https://www.python.org/downloads/"
2. install python virtual environment "virtualenv"
    - after install python open cmd and run this commands
        -"pip install virtualenv"


open cmd and go to the directory you like to create virtual environment
"python -m venv env_folder" --> you can replace the env_folder with name you like
    

move the folder you extracted - "dj_store"-  into the env_folder
then in cmd run commands:
    1."cd dj_store"  --> go to the directory of dj_store folder
    2."../Scripts/activate" --> activate the virtual environment
    3."pip install -r requirements.txt" --> install all libraries required to run the project
    4."python manage.py makemigrations" --> collect database changes
    5."python manage.py migrate" --> apply database changes
    6."python manage.py createsuperuser" --> create superuser for the site
    7."python manage.py runserver" --> run the project

then open the browser (firefox, chrome, edge..)
the go to url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

all above steps are for first time to run the project
but for later times we only do this:
    in cmd run commands:
    1."cd dj_store"  --> go to the directory of dj_store folder
    2."../Scripts/activate" --> activate the virtual environment
    7."python manage.py runserver" --> run the project

then open the browser (firefox, chrome, edge..)
the go to url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
